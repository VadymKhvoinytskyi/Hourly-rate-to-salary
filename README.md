# Count your salary

Different countries, companies and positions have different rates to count salaries. 
There are three most used: hourly, monthly and yearly rates. 

The hardest to recalculate in the other rates is an hourly rate. So I create a python script to solve a problem.

To calculate you should write in JSON file: period, hourly rate and additional info if needed. 
After that, you can run the script and receive the info on how much you will earn in the chosen period.

Feel free to add suggestions to improve the script!
